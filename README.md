# webscraper
Example webscraper using selenium. Branches showing xpath vs css selector methods vs beautiful soup usage are included.

This webscraper has been put together from the following tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/if-you-like-to-travel-let-python-help-you-scrape-the-best-fares-5a1f26213086

The tutorial demonstrates how to run an automated test browser using chromedriver and selenium. XPath references are used to select elements. Going further than the tutorial, I explored the use of CSS selectors. 

I also explored the use of beautiful to scrape the source html for the page, and scrape information without a test browser.
